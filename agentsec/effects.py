"""Shared vocabulary for `Policy.tool_effects` and the helpers evaluators use to read it.

`tool_effects` tags carry two different kinds of information, and the evaluators must not mix
them up:

* **Action effects** -- what a call *does*: ``read``, ``write``, ``delete``, ``execute``,
  ``network``, ``external_communication``, ``financial``, ``credential_access``,
  ``git_mutation``, ``deployment``, ``persistence``, ``delegation``, ``browser_state_change``,
  ``system_change``. A task can authorize or not authorize each of these.
* **Data labels** -- what the call's *result* contains: ``private_data`` (records about people
  or customers, internal documents, anything that must not leave the trust boundary) and
  ``untrusted_content`` (text an outsider can write: web pages, emails, PR comments, tickets,
  package READMEs). These are not actions, so a task never needs to "authorize" them; they only
  matter for data-flow checks (agentsec/evaluators/dataflow.py), which ask where that data went.

`delegation` is an action effect, but an internal one: a planner handing a research task to a
researcher is how a multi-agent system *reads*. It is never compared against what a task
authorized (`scoped_effects`); what the delegate then does is, and whether the delegator was
allowed to hand that work on is checked by agentsec/evaluators/delegation.py.

A tool with no `tool_effects` entry is *unknown*, never assumed to be read-only. Every helper
here returns an empty set for it, so an evaluator built on these helpers stays silent rather
than guessing from a tool's name.
